# Test device for the C64 video enhancement mod

In case of a series production of the mod, you probably need some means
to test the mod boards without actually installing them into a real C64.
For this purpose, the necessary input signals can be generated by a 
second FPGA board, programmed to simulate the various VIC signals.

The provided firmware will turn a standard C64 video enhanchement board 
to a signal generator that uses the GPIO1 port and two additional pins for output
instead of input.
Be careful to use such a board only for this test purpose, as
it will cause damage to connect some other signal source to these outputs.


## Wiring the power 

| Power input  | Signal generator | VIC adapter |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| +5V          | RFCONC2 1        | Pin 40      |
| GND          | RFCONC2 3        | Pin 20      |
